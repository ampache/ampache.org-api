This page focuses on a single object type.

Refer to the main [Advanced Search](https://ampache.org/api/api-advanced-search) page for further information regarding the advanced_search method.

### Available search rules

Select the type of search based on the type of data you are searching for. (songs, playlists, etc)

### Available operator values

Select your operator (integer only!) based on the type or your selected search

**NOTE** with the numeric_limit and is_true operators the operator is ignored, but still required

Send the correct input based on the type of search.

| rule_1_input |
|--------------|
| text         |
| integer      |
| boolean      |

**NOTE** To search metadata you need to add a 4th rule "rule_*_subtype"

Operators for metadata are using the text/tag types **AND** numeric types in a single list as they can be ints/strings/dates.

Currently there is not a simple way to identify what metadata types you have saved. New methods will be created for this.

### Metadata operator table

| rule_1_operator | Metadata                          |
|:---------------:|-----------------------------------|
|        0        | contains                          |
|        1        | does not contain                  |
|        2        | starts with                       |
|        3        | ends with                         |
|        4        | is                                |
|        5        | is not                            |
|  6 (Text Only)  | sounds like                       |
|  7 (Text Only)  | does not sound like               |
|  8 (Text Only)  | matches regular expression        |
|  9 (Text Only)  | does not match regular expression |
|       10        | is greater than or equal to       |
|       11        | is less than or equal to          |
|       12        | is                                |
|       13        | is not                            |
|       14        | is greater than                   |
|       15        | is less than                      |

To search a mixed type like metadata you must search using 4 rules.

* Search rule 1 for band containing 'Prodigy', Search Rule 2 for bbm > 120
  * rule name (e.g. rule_1['metadata'], rule_2['metadata'])
  * rule operator (e.g. rule_1_operator[0], rule_2_operator[12])
  * rule input (e.g. rule_1_input['Prodigy'], rule_2_input['120'])
  * rule subtype (e.g. rule_1_subtype['4'], rule_2_subtype['9'])
