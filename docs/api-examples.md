## Example Responses

Ampache's API has documented API responses for XML and JSON servers available from the [python3-ampache repo](https://github.com/ampache/python3-ampache)

Responses have been created using the ```build_docs.py``` python script and are not edited for formatting.

Each API version has it's own examples.
